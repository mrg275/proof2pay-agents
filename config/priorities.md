# Proof2Pay - Current Company Priorities

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Current Phase
Phase 2 of product development (AI Pipeline). Phase 1 (Core Data Model & Rules Engine) is complete and validated.

## Top Priorities (Ordered)

### 1. Complete Phase 2 Build
- Document segmentation (Pass 1)
- Structured extraction (Pass 2)
- PII handling & entity resolution
- Compliance validation service
- Invoice assembly
- All behind abstraction interfaces using commodity providers

### 2. Prepare for Pilot Conversations
- Need compliance talking points (what we can credibly say about security pre-certification)
- Need agency target prioritization (who to approach first)
- Need polished pitch materials (deck, one-pager)

### 3. Capture Co-Founder Domain Knowledge
- Systematically process incoming documents from co-founder
- Identify product gaps and edge cases from real agency materials
- Build the agency intelligence knowledge base

### 4. Fundraising Preparation
- Market sizing narrative (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Investor pipeline (GovTech-focused pre-seed/seed funds)
- Pitch deck development

### 5. Brand & Identity
- Evaluate naming (Proof2Pay or alternatives)
- Establish visual and verbal identity
- Messaging framework for agencies vs. investors vs. NPOs

## Key Context
- Two-person founding team: Matthew (technical, building product) + co-founder (agency relationships, domain expertise, former head of NYC human services)
- Bootstrapping, preparing for pre-seed raise
- Warm leads exist for pilot agencies
- No customers yet - product readiness is the priority
- Co-founder has extensive network and sends frequent industry documents that need product-level analysis

## What Agents Should NOT Do
- Do not produce work that requires founder time to review unless it's high-value
- Do not duplicate research across agents
- Do not generate generic/filler content - every output should be specific and actionable
- Do not make assumptions about the product that contradict the architecture docs
